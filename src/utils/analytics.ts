export const trackEvent = (eventName: string, properties?: Record<string, any>) => {
  // In a real implementation, this would send data to an analytics platform
  console.log(`[ANALYTICS] ${eventName}`, properties || {});
  
  // This would normally connect to something like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.
  // For now we just log to console for demonstration purposes
